"""
Phase 1: Hunk-level commit decomposition
=========================================

Problem
-------
AI agents can stage whole files (git add) but cannot drive git add -p.
They produce large file-level commits where you want many small, logical ones.

Three-phase approach
--------------------
This script is Phase 1 of three:

  Phase 1 (this slice tool, mechanical):
    Decomposes all staged changes into one atomic commit per diff hunk.

  Phase 2 (AI agent):
    Reads the N temp commits and decides which hunks belong together
    (e.g. "commits 1-5 → feat: auth, 6-12 → refactor: schema,
    13-15 → test: auth"). Outputs a grouping spec (JSON).

  Phase 3 (group tool, mechanical):
    Executes the rebase plan non-interactively via GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR,
    collapsing the temp commits into clean final commits.

Algorithm (Phase 1)
-------------------
  1. Run `git diff --cached -U3` on the index (or specified files).
  2. Parse the first hunk from the output (first @@ block of the first
     file), including the required diff/---/+++ header lines, to form
     a self-contained mini-patch.
  3. Apply that hunk to a throwaway temp index (GIT_INDEX_FILE) seeded
     from HEAD. The real staged index stays untouched.
  4. Write the resulting tree and create a commit via git commit-tree
     (plumbing, no hooks), then advance HEAD with git update-ref.
     Temp commits carry the Git Curate <git-curate@local> author so
     group and abort can detect them.
  5. Repeat from step 1. HEAD advances each iteration so the staged diff
     shrinks as committed hunks move into HEAD.
  6. Stop when `git diff --cached` returns empty.

Replaying them in order reconstructs the original staged state.

Key properties
--------------
- Non-destructive: the real staged index stays untouched.
- No stale offsets: the loop re-reads the diff each iteration.
- Conflict-free: only repackages state that already exists.
- Works for new files, deletions, and modified files alike.
- Pager-safe: uses --no-pager and color.ui=false to avoid delta/less
  and ANSI escape codes corrupting the diff output.

Usage
-----
    # Slice all staged changes:
    uvx git-curate slice

    # Slice only specific files:
    uvx git-curate slice src/auth.py src/schema.py

    # Dry-run — show what would be committed without committing:
    uvx git-curate slice --dry-run

    # Stage all unstaged changes then slice:
    uvx git-curate slice --all

    # Rewrite history from an earlier commit (inclusive):
    uvx git-curate slice --from abc1234

    # Slice again after making more changes (iterative workflow):
    uvx git-curate slice
