"""
Phase 2 helper: emit the unformatted diff for grouping
=======================================================

Prints `git log -p` from a base ref to HEAD, with no pager, no colour,
and no other formatting — ready to pipe to a model or script.

Without an explicit base, resolve_base() finds the first non-curate commit
walking back from HEAD. With no active session and no explicit base, the
command exits silently.

Usage:
------
    # Default: diff since the git-curate session base
    uvx git-curate diff

    # Explicit base ref or SHA
    uvx git-curate diff main
    uvx git-curate diff a1b2c3d
