"""Hunk-overlap dependency detection between temp commits.

When multiple slice sessions precede a single curate, two temp commits can
touch the same lines in the same file.  Reordering them during the group phase
causes a rebase conflict.  This module detects such pairs and expresses them as
explicit ordering constraints so the AI agent and the group validator can both
act on them.
